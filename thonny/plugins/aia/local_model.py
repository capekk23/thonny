"""Keep the local model (Ollama) loaded while Thonny runs.

Loading gpt-oss:20b takes 35-55 s on CPU and Ollama unloads an idle model after
5 minutes, so the first error explanation of a lesson would wait almost a minute
just for the load. Instead the model is loaded at startup and its keep_alive is
renewed periodically; every chat request renews it too (``KEEP_ALIVE`` in the
provider). A refresh instead of ``keep_alive=-1`` means a crashed Thonny frees
the memory (about 13 GB) within ``KEEP_ALIVE`` - a clean exit frees it at once.

A load that Ollama did not answer (not started yet - its tray app starts with Windows and
may come up after Thonny) is retried after ``RETRY_MS``, not after ``REFRESH_MS``:
otherwise the first error of a lesson waited for the whole load anyway. A load that Ollama
refused (the model is not pulled - 404, it does not fit into memory - 500) is not retried
(Jakub 2026-10-17, cortex-zamestnani#80): the next attempt comes with another choice in
Tools > Options or after the local model answers a chat request (``model_answered``).
Until then the chat request tells the student why it fails.

Threading: the timer and option reads run on the UI thread, the HTTP requests in
a daemon thread with a frozen provider.
